# Duke News Scraper

This project was created because I am a die-hard Duke Blue Devils fan.  The intent of this application is to allow the user to get all Duke articles in one place.  For the purposes of this project, all the articles are collected from the Raleigh News&Observer.  I do not take credit for writing or producing any content on this page.
